# 🧠 The Quantum Mind: A Living Theory of Coherence and Consciousness

## ⚡️ TL;DR

This theory proposes that **coherence across physical, energetic, and informational systems** gives rise to what we experience as "mind."  
Consciousness is not housed in the brain — it emerges through **resonant synchronization** across layers of the body, field, and identity.

## 🧭 Key Metaphors

- **Data Center : Body : Field** → layered coherence
- **Entanglement = Attention** → binds perception + memory
- **Waveform Collapse = Choice** → action as quantum resolution
- **The Body = Instrument, not container** → resonance over storage

---

## 🧬 Components in Development

- Quantum trauma as disrupted coherence
- RITUAL Framework as applied physics
- Somatic coherence maps
- Practical exercises for tuning inner resonance

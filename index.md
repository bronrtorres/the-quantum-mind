# 🧠 The Quantum Mind  
**A Living Theory of Coherence and Consciousness**  
*by Bron R. Torres*

---

This theory proposes that **consciousness is not stored in the brain**, but rather **emerges from the coherence** of physical, energetic, and informational systems.  
It’s a living model — one that grows through insight, contradiction, and refinement.

## ⚡️ Core Metaphors

- **Data Center : Body : Field** → A layered view of awareness and capacity  
- **Entanglement = Attention** → The force that binds meaning across dimensions  
- **Waveform Collapse = Choice** → Every action defines a timeline  
- **The Body = Instrument, not Container** → Consciousness as resonance, not storage
